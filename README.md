### Description

Parrot is a full stack app created in React Native and Ruby on Rails with Postgres. It is optimized for iOS and designed to encourage learners to learn a new language by incentivizing them with points earned after each lesson created. With these points, they may purchase custom "parrots" that are persisted on their account. As of now, the project is just a demoâ€” however, I hope to expand it to include multiple languages, authentication, a sign-up page, and lessons curated by seasoned experts.

### Running

First, enter bundle install and npm install --prefix client. These will install the dependencies needed to run the app. Then, seed the rails database with rails db:seed and run the database using rails s and the front end using npm start --prefix client. To enter the app, type in "gtduncan@usc.edu" as the e-mail and the password of "123".
